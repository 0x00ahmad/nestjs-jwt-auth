# What am I looking at?

It's auth, in nestjs. As it says

I wrote this around 1-2 years ago to learn how auth works.

I just updated it's packages to latest, to test run and ensure it at least runs on `pnpm dev`

## How to run it

You need a valid postgres url in the `.env` file to perform database queries

I used `pnpm` with `node` so here are the commands:

```bash

pnpm i
pnpm db:push

pnpm dev

```
